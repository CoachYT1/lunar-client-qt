## Agents
One of the primary features of this launcher is the ability to easily attach java premain agents to your game, 
this allows you to modify the game on launch which lets you write modifications that won't break when lunar recieves an update. 
  
Here's a repository containing some useful java agents that you might want to use: https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-client-agents  
If you're familiar with java bytecode feel free to write your own!

## Launching without launcher
A useful feature of this launcher is the ability to with the click of a button immediately get into lunar client without the hassle every time
of having to be faced with a launcher interface. Launch Lunar Client Qt with the --nogui argument and you will be launched into lunar client using
the options you have used in the previous launch.

## Windir spoofing
Another feature is the spoofing/disabling of the windows directory for lunar client, which on most systems is "C:\WINDOWS".
This allows the user to prevent lunar client from accessing the hosts file and the tasklists command, or to spoof these files.

If you wish to spoof these files, keep in mind that directory structures need to be the same as inside of the windir file, e.g. create 
System32\drivers\etc in your custom directory and insert a hosts file in it. The tasklist.exe needs to be present in the System32 directory.
This can be a copy of the original tasklist.exe, or an exe that replicates it's output. A repository created for this purpose is https://github.com/Youded-byte/tasklist-spoof

## Build instructions
Make sure you have Qt 5.15+ and CMake 3.16+ installed. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-client-qt.git
cd lunar-client-qt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

```

**NOTE**  
If you're on mac, you wanna start off by installing qt using brew: ```brew install qt@5```  
You also want to replace the ```cmake ..``` command with ```cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/ ..```
